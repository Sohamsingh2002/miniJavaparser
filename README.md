# Minijava Parser

This project implements a lexer and parser for a simple programming language. The lexer converts source code into tokens, while the parser processes these tokens to build a parse tree representing the structure of the code. The grammar and language features supported by the lexer and parser are specified within the grammar.txt file

## Using the Lexer and Parser

1 Compilation
```bash
  g++ parse.cpp -o parser
```
2 Running Parser
```bash
  ./parser
```
3 Give input file name

4 Generate tree.dot and token.txt file for given input
## Tech Stack

The tech stack for the lexer and parser project includes:

- Programming Language: C++
- Libraries/Tools:
  - Standard Template Library (STL)
  - File I/O (fstream)
- Development Environment: Any C++ compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, CLion)
 - Graph Visualization Tool: Graphviz

This project utilizes C++ for implementing the lexer and parser, along with the STL for data structures and file I/O operations. Graphviz is used to visualize the parse tree generated by the parser
